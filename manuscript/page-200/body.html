<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Well, well, I&rsquo;ll drop past history and get down to present-day facts. I called last night, as I have already said, at the Manor House. I did not see either Barker or Mrs. Douglas. I saw no necessity to disturb them; but I was pleased to hear that the lady was not visibly pining and that she had partaken of an excellent dinner. My visit was specially made to the good Mr. Ames, with whom I exchanged some amiabilities, which culminated in his allowing me, without reference to anyone else, to sit alone for a time in the study.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What! With that?&rdquo; I ejaculated.</p><p>&ldquo;No, no, everything is now in order. You gave permission for that, Mr. Mac, as I am informed. The room was in its normal state, and in it I passed an instructive quarter of an hour.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
