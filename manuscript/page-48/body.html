<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Jonathan Wild wasn&rsquo;t a detective, and he wasn&rsquo;t in a novel. He was a master criminal, and he lived last century&mdash;1750 or thereabouts.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then he&rsquo;s no use to me. I&rsquo;m a practical man.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Mac, the most practical thing that you ever did in your life would be to shut yourself up for three months and read twelve hours a day at the annals of crime. Everything comes in circles&mdash;even Professor Moriarty. Jonathan Wild was the hidden force of the London criminals, to whom he sold his brains and his organization on a fifteen per cent. commission. The old wheel turns, and the same spoke comes up. It&rsquo;s all been done before, and will be again. I&rsquo;ll tell you one or two things about Moriarty which may interest you.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
