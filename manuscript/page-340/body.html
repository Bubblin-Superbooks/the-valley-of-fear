He has been judged over there. That&rsquo;s no business of ours. All we have to do is to carry it out for them, same as they would for us. Speaking of that, two brothers from the Merton lodge are coming over to us next week to do some business in this quarter.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Who are they?&rdquo; asked someone.</p><p>&ldquo;Faith, it is wiser not to ask. If you know nothing, you can testify nothing, and no trouble can come of it. But they are men who will make a clean job when they are about it.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
