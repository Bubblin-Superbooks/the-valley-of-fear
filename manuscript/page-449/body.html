<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d come after you, Jack.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, no, you shall come WITH me. If this valley is closed to me and I can never come back, how can I leave you behind, and me perhaps in hiding from the police with never a chance of a message? It&rsquo;s with me you must come. I know a good woman in the place I come from, and it&rsquo;s there I&rsquo;d leave you till we can get married. Will you come?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, Jack, I will come.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;God bless you for your trust in me! It&rsquo;s a fiend out of hell that I should be if I abused it. Now, mark you, Ettie, it will be just a word to you, and when it reaches you, you will drop everything and come right down to the waiting room at the depot and stay there till I come for you.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
