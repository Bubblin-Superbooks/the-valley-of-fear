<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You can plan the rest for yourselves. Widow MacNamara&rsquo;s is a lonely house. She&rsquo;s as true as steel and as deaf as a post. There&rsquo;s only Scanlan and me in the house. If I get his promise&mdash;and I&rsquo;ll let you know if I do&mdash;I&rsquo;d have the whole seven of you come to me by nine o&rsquo;clock. We&rsquo;ll get him in. If ever he gets out alive&mdash;well, he can talk of Birdy Edwards&rsquo;s luck for the rest of his days!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s going to be a vacancy at Pinkerton&rsquo;s or I&rsquo;m mistaken. Leave it at that, McMurdo. At nine to-morrow we&rsquo;ll be with you. You once get the door shut behind him, and you can leave the rest with us.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
