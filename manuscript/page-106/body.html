<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;We can surely dismiss that,&rdquo; said MacDonald.</p><p>&ldquo;So I think. Suicide is out of the question. Then a murder has been done. What we have to determine is, whether it was done by someone outside or inside the house.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s hear the argument.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There are considerable difficulties both ways, and yet one or the other it must be. We will suppose first that some person or persons inside the house did the crime. They got this man down here at a time when everything was still and yet no one was asleep. They then did the deed with the queerest and noisiest weapon in the world so as to tell everyone what had happened&mdash;a weapon that was never seen in the house before. That does not seem a very likely start, does it?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
