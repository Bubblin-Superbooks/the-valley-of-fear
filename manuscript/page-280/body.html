He found her alone in the sitting-room that same evening, and he poured his troubles into her ear.</p><p>&ldquo;Sure, your father is after giving me notice,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s little I would care if it was just my room, but indeed, Ettie, though it&rsquo;s only a week that I&rsquo;ve known you, you are the very breath of life to me, and I can&rsquo;t live without you!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, hush, Mr. McMurdo, don&rsquo;t speak so!&rdquo; said the girl. &ldquo;I have told you, have I not, that you are too late?
