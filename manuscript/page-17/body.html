I fear, Watson, that all our expectations come to nothing. I trust that the man Porlock will come to no harm.</p><p>&ldquo;DEAR MR. HOLMES [he says]:</p><p>&ldquo;I will go no further in this matter. It is too dangerous&mdash;he suspects me. I can see that he suspects me. He came to me quite unexpectedly after I had actually addressed this envelope with the intention of sending you the key to the cipher. I was able to cover it up. If he had seen it, it would have gone hard with me. But I read suspicion in his eyes. Please burn the cipher message, which can now be of no use to you.</p></div> </div>
