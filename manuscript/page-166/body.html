According to the story given to us, the assassin had less than a minute after the murder had been committed to take that ring, which was under another ring, from the dead man&rsquo;s finger, to replace the other ring&mdash;a thing which he would surely never have done&mdash;and to put that singular card beside his victim. I say that this was obviously impossible.</p><p>&ldquo;You may argue&mdash;but I have too much respect for your judgment, Watson, to think that you will do so&mdash;that the ring may have been taken before the man was killed. The fact that the candle had been lit only a short time shows that there had been no lengthy interview.</p></div> </div>
