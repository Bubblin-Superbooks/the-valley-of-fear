I have not moved it since the day I was married, and it would have taken a file to get it off. I don&rsquo;t know, anyhow, that I should have cared to part with it; but if I had wanted to I couldn&rsquo;t. So we just had to leave that detail to take care of itself. On the other hand, I brought a bit of plaster down and put it where I am wearing one myself at this instant. You slipped up there, Mr. Holmes, clever as you are; for if you had chanced to take off that plaster you would have found no cut underneath it.</p></div> </div>
