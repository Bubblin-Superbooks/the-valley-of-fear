<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I have worked with Mr. Holmes before,&rdquo; said Inspector MacDonald. &ldquo;He plays the game.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My own idea of the game, at any rate,&rdquo; said Holmes, with a smile. &ldquo;I go into a case to help the ends of justice and the work of the police. If I have ever separated myself from the official force, it is because they have first separated themselves from me. I have no wish ever to score at their expense. At the same time, Mr. White Mason, I claim the right to work in my own way and give my results at my own time&mdash;complete rather than in stages.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
