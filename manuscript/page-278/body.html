<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>McMurdo laughed incredulously. &ldquo;How can you prove that?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Prove it! Are there not fifty murders to prove it? Vat about Milman and Van Shorst, and the Nicholson family, and old Mr. Hyam, and little Billy James, and the others? Prove it! Is there a man or a voman in this valley vat does not know it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;See here!&rdquo; said McMurdo earnestly. &ldquo;I want you to take back what you&rsquo;ve said, or else make it good. One or the other you must do before I quit this room. Put yourself in my place. Here am I, a stranger in the town. I belong to a society that I know only as an innocent one. You&rsquo;ll find it through the length and breadth of the States, but always as an innocent one. Now, when I am counting upon joining it here, you tell me that it is the same as a murder society called the Scowrers. I guess you owe me either an apology or else an explanation, Mr. Shafter.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
