<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I&rsquo;ve been cooped up two days, and I&rsquo;ve spent the daylight hours&mdash;as much daylight as I could get in that rat trap&mdash;in putting the thing into words. You&rsquo;re welcome to them&mdash;you and your public. There&rsquo;s the story of the Valley of Fear.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the past, Mr. Douglas,&rdquo; said Sherlock Holmes quietly. &ldquo;What we desire now is to hear your story of the present.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have it, sir,&rdquo; said Douglas. &ldquo;May I smoke as I talk? Well, thank you, Mr. Holmes. You&rsquo;re a smoker yourself, if I remember right, and you&rsquo;ll guess what it is to be sitting for two days with tobacco in your pocket and afraid that the smell will give you away.&rdquo; He leaned against the mantelpiece and sucked at the cigar which Holmes had handed him.</p></div> </div>
