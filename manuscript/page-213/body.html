<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;This is what we are after, Mr. Barker&mdash;this bundle, weighted with a dumb-bell, which you have just raised from the bottom of the moat.&rdquo;</p><p>Barker stared at Holmes with amazement in his face. &ldquo;How in thunder came you to know anything about it?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Simply that I put it there.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You put it there! You!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Perhaps I should have said &lsquo;replaced it there,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Holmes. &ldquo;You will remember, Inspector MacDonald, that I was somewhat struck by the absence of a dumb-bell. I drew your attention to it; but with the pressure of other events you had hardly the time to give it the consideration which would have enabled you to draw deductions from it. When water is near and a weight is missing it is not a very far-fetched supposition that something has been sunk in the water.</p></div> </div>
