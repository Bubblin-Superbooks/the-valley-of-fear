<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> It was the worst enemy I had among them all&mdash;one who has been after me like a hungry wolf after a caribou all these years. I knew there was trouble coming, and I came home and made ready for it. I guessed I&rsquo;d fight through it all right on my own, my luck was a proverb in the States about &lsquo;76. I never doubted that it would be with me still.</p><p>&ldquo;I was on my guard all that next day, and never went out into the park. It&rsquo;s as well, or he&rsquo;d have had the drop on me with that buckshot gun of his before ever I could draw on him. After the bridge was up&mdash;my mind was always more restful when that bridge was up in the evenings&mdash;I put the thing clear out of my head. I never dreamed of his getting into the house and waiting for me.</p></div> </div>
