It didn&rsquo;t say &lsquo;horrible&rsquo;: that&rsquo;s not a recognized official term. It gave the name John Douglas. It mentioned that his injuries had been in the head, from the discharge of a shotgun. It also mentioned the hour of the alarm, which was close on to midnight last night. It added that the case was undoubtedly one of murder, but that no arrest had been made, and that the case was one which presented some very perplexing and extraordinary features. That&rsquo;s absolutely all we have at present, Mr. Holmes.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
