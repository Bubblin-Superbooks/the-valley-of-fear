<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Another point: I made it my business to hunt down some of Moriarty&rsquo;s checks lately&mdash;just common innocent checks that he pays his household bills with. They were drawn on six different banks. Does that make any impression on your mind?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Queer, certainly! But what do you gather from it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That he wanted no gossip about his wealth. No single man should know what he had. I have no doubt that he has twenty banking accounts; the bulk of his fortune abroad in the Deutsche Bank or the Credit Lyonnais as likely as not. Sometime when you have a year or two to spare I commend to you the study of Professor Moriarty.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
