<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>McMurdo took out an envelope and held it close to the murky oil lamp. &ldquo;Here is the address&mdash;Jacob Shafter, Sheridan Street. It&rsquo;s a boarding house that was recommended by a man I knew in Chicago.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know it; but Vermissa is out of my beat. I live at Hobson&rsquo;s Patch, and that&rsquo;s here where we are drawing up. But, say, there&rsquo;s one bit of advice I&rsquo;ll give you before we part: If you&rsquo;re in trouble in Vermissa, go straight to the Union House and see Boss McGinty. He is the Bodymaster of Vermissa Lodge, and nothing can happen in these parts unless Black Jack McGinty wants it. So long, mate! Maybe we&rsquo;ll meet in lodge one of these evenings. But mind my words: If you are in trouble, go to Boss McGinty.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
