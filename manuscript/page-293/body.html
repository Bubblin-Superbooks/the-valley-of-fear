I&rsquo;ve heard that there is no harm in being a Freeman anywhere but here; so why should I think the worse of you for that? But if you are a Freeman, Jack, why should you not go down and make a friend of Boss McGinty? Oh, hurry, Jack, hurry! Get your word in first, or the hounds will be on your trail.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I was thinking the same thing,&rdquo; said McMurdo. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go right now and fix it. You can tell your father that I&rsquo;ll sleep here to-night and find some other quarters in the morning.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
