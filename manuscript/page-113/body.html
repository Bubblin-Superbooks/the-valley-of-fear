Had you noticed anything unusual in his conduct, yesterday, Ames?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It struck me that he was a little restless and excited, sir.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ha! The attack may not have been entirely unexpected. We do seem to make a little progress, do we not? Perhaps you would rather do the questioning, Mr. Mac?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
