I was an officer in Chicago before ever I came to this darned coal bunker, and I know a Chicago crook when I see one.&rdquo;</p><p>McMurdo&rsquo;s face fell. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me that you&rsquo;re Marvin of the Chicago Central!&rdquo; he cried.</p><p>&ldquo;Just the same old Teddy Marvin, at your service. We haven&rsquo;t forgotten the shooting of Jonas Pinto up there.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I never shot him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Did you not? That&rsquo;s good impartial evidence, ain&rsquo;t it? Well, his death came in uncommon handy for you, or they would have had you for shoving the queer. Well, we can let that be bygones; for, between you and me&mdash;and perhaps I&rsquo;m going further than my duty in saying it&mdash;they could get no clear case against you, and Chicago&rsquo;s open to you to-morrow.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
