A man in uniform advanced into the room, a six-shooter in his hand. It was Captain Marvin, once of Chicago, and now of the Mine Constabulary. He shook his head with a half-smile at McMurdo.</p><p>&ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d be getting into trouble, Mr. Crooked McMurdo of Chicago,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t keep out of it, can you? Take your hat and come along with us.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;ll pay for this, Captain Marvin,&rdquo; said McGinty. &ldquo;Who are you, I&rsquo;d like to know, to break into a house in this fashion and molest honest, law-abiding men?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
