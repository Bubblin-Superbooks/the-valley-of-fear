<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;That is just the point which I want to come to, Mrs. Douglas. You have known your husband only in England, have you not?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, we have been married five years.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Have you heard him speak of anything which occurred in America and might bring some danger upon him?&rdquo;</p><p>Mrs. Douglas thought earnestly before she answered. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said at last, &ldquo;I have always felt that there was a danger hanging over him. He refused to discuss it with me. It was not from want of confidence in me&mdash;there was the most complete love and confidence between us&mdash;but it was out of his desire to keep all alarm away from me. He thought I should brood over it if I knew all, and so he was silent.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
