We could put him down an old shaft when we&rsquo;ve done with him; but however we work it we can&rsquo;t get past the man living at Hobson&rsquo;s Patch and you being there to-day.&rdquo;</p><p>McMurdo shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;If we handle it right, they can never prove the killing,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;No one can see him come to the house after dark, and I&rsquo;ll lay to it that no one will see him go. Now see here, Councillor, I&rsquo;ll show you my plan and I&rsquo;ll ask you to fit the others into it. You will all come in good time. Very well.</p></div> </div>
