I made some inquiries myself about the matter. He seems to be a very respectable, learned, and talented sort of man.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;ve got so far as to recognize the talent.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Man, you can&rsquo;t but recognize it! After I heard your view I made it my business to see him. I had a chat with him on eclipses. How the talk got that way I canna think; but he had out a reflector lantern and a globe, and made it all clear in a minute.</p></div> </div>
