<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Oh, Jack, it would be the saving of you!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m an honest man in some things, Ettie. I wouldn&rsquo;t hurt a hair of your bonny head for all that the world can give, nor ever pull you down one inch from the golden throne above the clouds where I always see you. Would you trust me?&rdquo;</p><p>She put her hand in his without a word. &ldquo;Well, then, listen to what I say, and do as I order you, for indeed it&rsquo;s the only way for us. Things are going to happen in this valley. I feel it in my bones. There may be many of us that will have to look out for ourselves. I&rsquo;m one, anyhow. If I go, by day or night, it&rsquo;s you that must come with me!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
