<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I had a conscience and a religion; but they made me a criminal among them. I was chosen for a job. If I backed down I knew well what would come to me. Maybe I&rsquo;m a coward. Maybe it&rsquo;s the thought of my poor little woman and the children that makes me one. Anyhow I went. I guess it will haunt me forever.</p><p>&ldquo;It was a lonely house, twenty miles from here, over the range yonder. I was told off for the door, same as you were last night. They could not trust me with the job. The others went in. When they came out their hands were crimson to the wrists. As we turned away a child was screaming out of the house behind us. It was a boy of five who had seen his father murdered.</p></div> </div>
