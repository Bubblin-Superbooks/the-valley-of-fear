Then I wound it up myself.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then it comes to this,&rdquo; said the sergeant: &ldquo;If anyone came from outside&mdash;IF they did&mdash;they must have got in across the bridge before six and been in hiding ever since, until Mr. Douglas came into the room after eleven.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is so! Mr. Douglas went round the house every night the last thing before he turned in to see that the lights were right. That brought him in here. The man was waiting and shot him. Then he got away through the window and left his gun behind him. That&rsquo;s how I read it; for nothing else will fit the facts.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
