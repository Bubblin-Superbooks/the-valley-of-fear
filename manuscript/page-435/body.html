<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>It was a Saturday evening in May. Saturday was always the lodge night, and McMurdo was leaving his house to attend it when Morris, the weaker brother of the order, came to see him. His brow was creased with care, and his kindly face was drawn and haggard.</p><p>&ldquo;Can I speak with you freely, Mr. McMurdo?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t forget that I spoke my heart to you once, and that you kept it to yourself, even though the Boss himself came to ask you about it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What else could I do if you trusted me? It wasn&rsquo;t that I agreed with what you said.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
