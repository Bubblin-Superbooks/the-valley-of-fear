<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the chief foreman of the Iron Dike Company. He&rsquo;s a hard citizen, an old colour sergeant of the war, all scars and grizzle. We&rsquo;ve had two tries at him; but had no luck, and Jim Carnaway lost his life over it. Now it&rsquo;s for you to take it over. That&rsquo;s the house&mdash;all alone at the Iron Dike crossroad, same as you see here on the map&mdash;without another within earshot. It&rsquo;s no good by day. He&rsquo;s armed and shoots quick and straight, with no questions asked. But at night&mdash;well, there he is with his wife, three children, and a hired help. You can&rsquo;t pick or choose. It&rsquo;s all or none.</p></div> </div>
