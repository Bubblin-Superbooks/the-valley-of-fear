<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Well, since you ask me, I spent, as I told you that I would, some hours last night at the Manor House.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, what happened?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, I can only give you a very general answer to that for the moment. By the way, I have been reading a short but clear and interesting account of the old building, purchasable at the modest sum of one penny from the local tobacconist.&rdquo;</p><p>Here Holmes drew a small tract, embellished with a rude engraving of the ancient Manor House, from his waistcoat pocket.</p><p>&ldquo;It immensely adds to the zest of an investigation, my dear Mr. Mac, when one is in conscious sympathy with the historical atmosphere of one&rsquo;s surroundings. Don&rsquo;t look so impatient; for I assure you that even so bald an account as this raises some sort of picture of the past in one&rsquo;s mind. Permit me to give you a sample.</p></div> </div>
