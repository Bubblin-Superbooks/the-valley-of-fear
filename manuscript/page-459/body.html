He had filled the form with stuff that might have been Chinese, for all we could make of it. &lsquo;He fires a sheet of this off every day,&rsquo; said the clerk. &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;it&rsquo;s special news for his paper, and he&rsquo;s scared that the others should tap it.&rsquo; That was what the operator thought and what I thought at the time; but I think differently now.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
