<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go to the Patch to-morrow morning. I&rsquo;ll find him through the operator. He can locate him, I guess. Well, then I&rsquo;ll tell him that I&rsquo;m a Freeman myself. I&rsquo;ll offer him all the secrets of the lodge for a price. You bet he&rsquo;ll tumble to it. I&rsquo;ll tell him the papers are at my house, and that it&rsquo;s as much as my life would be worth to let him come while folk were about. He&rsquo;ll see that that&rsquo;s horse sense. Let him come at ten o&rsquo;clock at night, and he shall see everything. That will fetch him sure.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
