I have information that the most powerful and richest organizations in this state have bound themselves together for our destruction, and that at this very moment there is a Pinkerton detective, one Birdy Edwards, at work in the valley collecting the evidence which may put a rope round the necks of many of us, and send every man in this room into a felon&rsquo;s cell. That is the situation for the discussion of which I have made a claim of urgency.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
