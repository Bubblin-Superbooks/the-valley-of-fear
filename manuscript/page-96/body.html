Oh, man, it&rsquo;s just inconceivable! It&rsquo;s clean against common sense!

The ring business and the card point to premeditated murder for some private reason. Very good. Here is a man who slips into a house with the deliberate intention of committing murder. He knows, if he knows anything, that he will have a deeficulty in making his escape, as the house is surrounded with water. What weapon would he choose? You would say the most silent in the world.</p></div> </div>
