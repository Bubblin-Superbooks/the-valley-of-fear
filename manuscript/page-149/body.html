<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;There is one other point,&rdquo; said Inspector MacDonald. &ldquo;You met Mr. Douglas in a boarding house in London, did you not, and became engaged to him there? Was there any romance, anything secret or mysterious, about the wedding?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There was romance. There is always romance. There was nothing mysterious.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He had no rival?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, I was quite free.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You have heard, no doubt, that his wedding ring has been taken. Does that suggest anything to you? Suppose that some enemy of his old life had tracked him down and committed this crime, what possible reason could he have for taking his wedding ring?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
