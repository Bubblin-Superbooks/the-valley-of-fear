It&rsquo;s past two now. I take it for granted that since dawn every constable within forty miles has been looking out for a wet stranger?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is so, Mr. Holmes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, unless he has a burrow close by or a change of clothes ready, they can hardly miss him. And yet they HAVE missed him up to now!&rdquo; Holmes had gone to the window and was examining with his lens the blood mark on the sill. &ldquo;It is clearly the tread of a shoe. It is remarkably broad; a splay-foot, one would say. Curious, because, so far as one can trace any footmark in this mud-stained corner, one would say it was a more shapely sole. However, they are certainly very indistinct. What&rsquo;s this under the side table?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
