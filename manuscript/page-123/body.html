No, she was not hurrying; it did not seem to him that she was particularly agitated. Just as she reached the bottom of the stair Mr. Barker had rushed out of the study. He had stopped Mrs. Douglas and begged her to go back.</p><p>&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, go back to your room!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Poor Jack is dead! You can do nothing. For God&rsquo;s sake, go back!&rdquo;</p><p>After some persuasion upon the stairs Mrs. Douglas had gone back. She did not scream. She made no outcry whatever.
