And yet, by the Lord! there is that skunk Morris. What about him? If any man gives us away, it would be he. I&rsquo;ve a mind to send a couple of the boys round before evening to give him a beating up and see what they can get from him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, there would be no harm in that,&rdquo; McMurdo answered. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t deny that I have a liking for Morris and would be sorry to see him come to harm. He has spoken to me once or twice over lodge matters, and though he may not see them the same as you or I, he never seemed the sort that squeals. But still it is not for me to stand between him and you.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
