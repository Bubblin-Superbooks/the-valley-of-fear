Pull it out, or by the Lord that made me&mdash;There, that will do. There are forty armed men round this house, and you can figure it out for yourself what chance you have. Take their pistols, Marvin!&rdquo;</p><p>There was no possible resistance under the menace of those rifles. The men were disarmed. Sulky, sheepish, and amazed, they still sat round the table.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to say a word to you before we separate,&rdquo; said the man who had trapped them. &ldquo;I guess we may not meet again until you see me on the stand in the courthouse. I&rsquo;ll give you something to think over between now and then. You know me now for what I am.</p></div> </div>
