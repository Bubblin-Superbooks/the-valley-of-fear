If you will come there now, I have something which it is important for you to hear and for me to say.</p><p>McMurdo read the note twice with the utmost surprise; for he could not imagine what it meant or who was the author of it. Had it been in a feminine hand, he might have imagined that it was the beginning of one of those adventures which had been familiar enough in his past life.</p></div> </div>
