We&rsquo;ve had the bicycle identified, and we have a description of our man; so that&rsquo;s a long step on our journey.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It sounds to me like the beginning of the end,&rdquo; said Holmes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I congratulate you both with all my heart.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I started from the fact that Mr. Douglas had seemed disturbed since the day before, when he had been at Tunbridge Wells. It was at Tunbridge Wells then that he had become conscious of some danger.

We took the bicycle over with us and showed it at the hotels.</p></div> </div>
